- 'Pokemon' class with stats, typing, nature, etc
- 'Attack' class with power, typing, extra effects
- 'Item' class
- Database usage for type effectiveness
- Database usage to get a pokemon data directly from its name
- Visual interface
### Extras
- Speed optimiser
- Bulk optimiser
- Multiple languages support
